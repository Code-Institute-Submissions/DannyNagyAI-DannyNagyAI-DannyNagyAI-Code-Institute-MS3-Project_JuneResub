#iSandwich

iSandwich is a Flask and MongoDB web application that helps users to find and share their Sandwich recipes online! 
This app allows users to get the most out of their passion with both sandwiches and sandwich recipes. With this app they can find new recipes, search ingredients, add new recipes, edit old recipes and delete their own recipes. 

##User Experience (UX)

This application is dedicated to all Sandwich lovers out there in the big world, that has been trying for years to find and share  their sandwich recipes with others online. 

iSandwich help users come together as a community to share their interest and passion for sandwiches. 

To be able to build the iSandwich app, I had to include:

A simple way of navigating around the page.
Login and sign up page for the users.
Showcase photos, information, ingredients and instructions of sandwich and different recipes.
Users should be able to add, edit and delete their recipes. 

I tried to stay on the same path during the entire project with colors, design and idea.

##Issues/problems/improvements
No known bugs or bigger problems, however some things should be fixed for a 2.0 version:
The "active" menu-item, when you scroll on page, the active button stops to indicate which page your on (you can still navigate, but active indicator doest not appear active).
The form on the contact page is not perfect, might need some adjustments like width of form elements. Also future version might also contain functionality on serverside to actually sending a email message. Probably we will use Python (or Java) language to parse the posted form content.
Hero images should be resized to less height, in order to view more of the page content at first glance.
