> **(iSandwich)**

iSandwich is a Flask and MongoDB web application that helps users to find and share their Sandwich recipes online! 
This app allows users to get the most out of their passion with both sandwiches and sandwich recipes. With this app they can find new recipes, search ingredients, add new recipes, edit old recipes and delete their own recipes. 

##User Experience (UX)

This application is dedicated to all Sandwich lovers out there in the big world, that has been trying for years to find and share  their sandwich recipes with others online. 

iSandwich help users come together as a community to share their interest and passion for sandwiches. 

To be able to build the iSandwich app, I had to include:

A simple way of navigating around the page.
Login and sign up page for the users.
Showcase photos, information, ingredients and instructions of sandwich and different recipes.
Users should be able to add, edit and delete their recipes. 

I tried to stay on the same path during the entire project with colors, design and idea.

##Issues/problems/improvements
No known bugs or bigger problems, however some  things should be fixed for a 2.0 version:

All of the pages could have much better design such as more beutiful pages, better details and an overall better experience for the users. 

The view page for the Sandwiches could have much more beutiful design solutions and better structured content cards, that looks more proffesional.

The search function could improve a lot... This is what happens when you run out of time before a deadline.

Show the display name of which user that has made the recipe. 

An allergens button to the Sandwich page, to be able to filter allergens faster. 

An input in the add sandiwch to upload files could be added instead.
