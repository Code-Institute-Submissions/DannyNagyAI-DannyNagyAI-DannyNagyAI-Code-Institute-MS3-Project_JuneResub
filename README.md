#iSandwich

iSandwich is a Flask and MongoDB web application that helps users to find and share their Sandwich recipes online! This app allows users to get the most out of their passion with both sandwiches and sandwich recipes. With this app they can find new recipes, search ingredients, add new recipes, edit old recipes and delete their own recipes.

##User Experience (UX)

This application is dedicated to all Sandwich lovers out there in the big world, that has been trying for years to find and share their sandwich recipes with others online.

iSandwich help users come together as a community to share their interest and passion for sandwiches.

To be able to build the iSandwich app, I had to include:

A simple way of navigating around the page. Login and sign up page for the users. Showcase photos, information, ingredients and instructions of sandwich and different recipes. Users should be able to add, edit and delete their recipes.

I tried to stay on the same path during the entire project with colors, design and idea.

###Sandwiches Page A big hero image of a sandwich. A nice view of all the sandwiches located in the app’s database. A search bar to search for specific ingredients. A category filter, to filter out different types of sandwiches that exist in the database.

###Login Page Input for both username, password and with a submit button below to login to the page.

###Sign up Page Input for username, password and an unique display name for the user (so that the user does not have to show his username during his/her session time, safety first!) to be able to get an account and login to the page.

###Profile Page Always the starting point for the logged in user and here the users can se their own display_names while logged in. The user can also both edit and delete their Sandwiches on this page.

###Add Sandwich Here the user can add and build their own recipe of a sandwich that they would like to share with others.

##Technologies used in the project HTML5 CSS Bootstrap JQuery JavaScript Python Pymongo Flask MongoDB Heroku

##Testing I have tested the iSandwich website and was unable to find any error or bad links on the website. Devices Used: iPhone x – iOS 11.4 iPad – iOS 11.2.2 & iOS 11.4.1 MacBook – iOS 11.4 PC – Windows 10 Browsers Used: Chrome Firefox Safari

##Issues/problems/improvements No known bugs or bigger problems, however some things should be fixed for a 2.0 version:

The search function could improve a lot... You only search for specific string at the moment. This is what happens when you run out of time before a deadline.

Show the display name of which user that has created the recipe.

An allergens button to the Sandwich page, to be able to filter allergens faster.

An file upload function instead in the "add sandiwch" page. The solution for this is about 90% done. Will be un-commentend in the next version.
